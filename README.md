# Topics

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Architecture

The application adheres to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. DDD focuses on real-world complexities and maps them to the software to create a model that evolves over time. It places a high emphasis on the core domain and domain logic, which aids in creating intricate designs based on the domain model.

Here's an explanation of each layer in the context of this application:

### api

The API layer in this context serves as a bridge between complex business logic and the external APIs, such as OpenAI. It shields the intricate details of the external services and offers a simplified interface for the rest of the application to communicate with these services. This allows the business logic to be more focus-oriented and maintainable, providing flexibility to change or swap external services without affecting the business logic.

### app

The app layer resides within the application layer. This layer includes application services and could house Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). It primarily coordinates the domain layer and the infrastructure layer, working as a bridge between business logic and user interface.

### domain

The domain layer is considered the heart of the software, which encapsulates the business domain's critical information. Its chief responsibility is to encapsulate and execute business rules and logic. It includes entities (like users), value objects, enumerations, etc., and should be agnostic of any specific technology or platform.

### presentation

This layer is responsible for the user interface of the application. It handles the visual representation and user interactions, including the components for adding and deleting topics. It communicates with the app layer to process user commands and represent the state of the UI elements.

### repo

The repo layer serves as the data access layer, housing the repositories. Repositories offer a method to retrieve and persist data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, etc., abstracting the complexities of these operations from the rest of the application.

### services

The services layer comprises service classes that encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally fit into entities or value objects in the domain layer. It offers an interface for the outer layers to interact with the domain layer.

### utils

This layer contains utility classes and functions that provide common functionality that can be used across the application. They are typically stateless and contain various helper methods.
