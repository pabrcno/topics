# Topics

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

App Structure: Your main screen (HomePage) acts as a hub for navigating to different parts of your app, as shown by the PageView in the body of your Scaffold.

## App Functionality:

The app has five main functionalities represented by Destination objects. These functionalities include:

### Chat functionality:

This is represented by the ChatBody widget. It involves user conversations with the AI.

## Chat history:

The ChatsList widget might show a list of past chats or conversations.

## Topics:

The TopicList widget is responsible for displaying various discussion topics or channels.

## Store:

The StorePage widget might take users to a page where they can purchase items or services.

## Settings:

The ConfigurationsPage widget could be where users can customize app settings.

State Management: Your app uses the Provider package for state management. You have a ChatProvider which seems to handle fetching user chats, topics, and message counts.
